===========

This repo contains C program(s) which implements common mathematical operations on 2D matrices. A 2D matrix is treated as a Struct storing the number of rows, number of columns and the array itself. 

I wrote this in order to refresh some concepts in C like structures and pointers and to learn using git. The functions are commonly used in an undergraduate course in maths or CS.

I am not aiming to write optimized code in the first attempt. However, I intend to optimize this code later, when I have enough experience.
